# Event-Driven E-Commerce Backend

This repository hosts a multi-service, event-driven backend for a small e-commerce system. It is built with Java 21, Spring Boot 3.3, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Redis. Each microservice lives under the `services/` directory and the project is managed with a Maven aggregator.

See `scripts/curl-samples.sh` for a quick end-to-end workflow exercising product creation, order placement, and cancellation.
